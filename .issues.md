# Lightweight issue tracking

- Add American Express card
- Auto-ignore Amazon card records for amazon purchases
- Wells Fargo may be grabbing the wrong dates?
- Recognize Amazon's two-factor authentication
- Ongoing: Keep using dependency injection more
- Add a prefix to each gatherer's log messages automatically
- Automate the Chase cards
- Implied: Parameterize and DRY out the gatherer classes a bit more

## Maybe:

- Try adding StyleCopAnalyzer?
- Get Venmo data?
- Get PayPal data?
- Improve performance by blocking fluff like images and fonts?
