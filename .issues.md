# Lightweight issue tracking

- Noticed that Wells Fargo just failed to download
- Rework the BrowserAutomationPool code
- Report failed (timed out) gatherers at the end of the run
- Automate the Chase cards

## Maybe:

- Get Venmo data?
- Get PayPal data?

## Done:

- Deal with the Citi promotional page and account changes
- Add automatic support for Wells Fargo cards
- Update code that handles paychecks
