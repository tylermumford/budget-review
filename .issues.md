# Lightweight issue tracking

- Ongoing: Keep using dependency injection more
- Log an error/warning when a gatherer times out
- Add a prefix to each gatherer's log messages automatically
- Report failed (timed out) gatherers at the end of the run
- Automate the Chase cards

## Maybe:

- Try adding StyleCopAnalyzer?
- Get Venmo data?
- Get PayPal data?
- Improve performance by blocking fluff like images and fonts?
    - [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-route)

## Done:

- Add a dependency injection container
- Rework the BrowserAutomationPool code
- ~~Noticed that Wells Fargo just failed to download~~ (could not reproduce)
- Deal with the Citi promotional page and account changes
- Add automatic support for Wells Fargo cards
- Update code that handles paychecks
